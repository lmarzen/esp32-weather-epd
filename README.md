This software has limited support for accent colors. E-paper panels with additional colors tend to have longer refresh times, which will reduce battery life.

### Enclosure Options

You'll want a nice way to show off your project. Here are a few popular choices.

- DIY Wooden
  - I made a small stand by hollowing out a piece of wood from the bottom. On the back, I used a short USB extension cable so that I can charge the battery without needing to remove the components from the stand. I also wired a small reset button to refresh the display manually. Additionally, I 3d printed a cover for the bottom, which is held on by magnets. The E-paper screen is very thin, so I used a thin piece of acrylic to support it.
  - Measurements:
    - depth = 63mm <br>
      height = 49mm <br>
      width = 170.2mm (= width of the screen) <br>
      screen angle = 80deg <br>
      screen is 15mm from the front
- 3D Printable

  - Here is a list of community designs.

### Solder-Free Component Selection (Optional)

This project can be completed without any soldering, if you choose your component selection carefully.

- Buy "Jumper Wires" to connect your components.
- Buy the [FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E w/ Headers](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2231.html?tracking=PfSxQ8).
- Buy a BME280 with headers soldered from the factory.
- Buy a reset switch that is compatible with jumper wires.

## Setup Guide

### Wiring

The battery can be charged by plugging the FireBeetle ESP32 into the wall via the USB-C connector while the battery is plugged into the ESP32's JST connector.

> **Warning**
> The polarity of JST-PH2.0 connectors is not standardized! You may need to swap the order of the wires in the connector.

NOTE: Waveshare now ships revision 2.3 of their e-paper HAT (no longer rev 2.2 ). Rev 2.3 has an additional `PWR` pin (not depicted in the wiring diagrams below); connect this pin to 3.3V.

IMPORTANT: The DESPI-C02 adapter has one physical switch that MUST be set correctly for the display to work.

- RESE: Set switch to position 0.47.

IMPORTANT: The Waveshare E-Paper Driver HAT has two physical switches that MUST be set correctly for the display to work.

- Display Config: Set switch to position B.

- Interface Config: Set switch to position 0.

Cut the low power pad for even longer battery life.

- From <https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_Board_ESP32_E_SKU_DFR0654>

  > Low Power Pad: This pad is specially designed for low power consumption. It is connected by default. You can cut off the thin wire in the middle with a knife to disconnect it. After disconnection, the static power consumption can be reduced by 500 μA. The power consumption can be reduced to 13 μA after controlling the maincontroller enter the sleep mode through the program. Note: when the pad is disconnected, you can only drive RGB LED light via the USB Power supply.

### Configuration, Compilation, and Upload

PlatformIO for VSCode is used for managing dependencies, code compilation, and uploading to ESP32.

1. Clone this repository or download and extract the .zip.

2. Install VSCode.

3. Follow these instructions to install the PlatformIO extension for VSCode: <https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode>

4. Open the project in VSCode.

   a. File > Open Folder...

   b. Navigate to this project and select the folder called "platformio".

5. Configure Options.

   - Most configuration options are located in [config.cpp](platformio/src/config.cpp), with a few in [config.h](platformio/include/config.h).

   - Important settings to configure in config.cpp:

     - WiFi credentials (ssid, password, ap ssid).
     - Open Weather Map API key (it's free, see next section for important notes about obtaining an API key).

     - Latitude and longitude.

     - Time and date formats.

     - Sleep duration.

   - Important settings to configure in config.h:

     - Units (Metric or Imperial).

   - Comments explain each option in detail.

6. Build and Upload Code.

   a. Connect ESP32 to your computer via USB.

   b. Click the upload arrow along the bottom of the VSCode window. (Should say "PlatformIO: Upload" if you hover over it.)

   - PlatformIO will automatically download the required third-party libraries, compile, and upload the code. :)

   - You will only see this if you have the PlatformIO extension installed.

   - If using a FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E and you receive the error `Wrong boot mode detected (0x13)! The chip needs to be in download mode.` unplug the power from the board, connect GPIO0 ([labeled 0/D5](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_Board_ESP32_E_SKU_DFR0654#target_5)) to GND, and power it back up to put the board in download mode.

7. Boot options.

- To support a change in WiFi networks without requiring a change in code and re-upload, [WiFi Manager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) has been integrated. To use this feature, pull HW pin 27 `PIN_CONFIGURE_WIFI` down and press and release the reset button. This will cause the weather station to create an ad-hoc wifi network named "Weather_Station" `WIFI_AP_SSID`. Connect to this network to configure the WiFi network. Visit the WiFi Manger site for further details.

  > **Note**
  > Each time you reset using this method the previously configured WiFi network will be lost. After you perform this reset the compiled defaults can still be used by performing a normal reset without connecting to the ad-hoc network and configuring the WiFi.

  - If you are getting other errors during the upload process, you may need to install drivers to allow you to upload code to the ESP32.

### OpenWeatherMap API Key

Sign up here to get an API key; it's free. <https://openweathermap.org/api>

This project will make calls to 2 different APIs ("One Call" and "Air Pollution").

- The One Call API 3.0 is only included in the "One Call by Call" subscription. This separate subscription includes 1,000 calls/day for free and allows you to pay only for the number of API calls made to this product.

Here's how to subscribe and avoid any credit card changes:

- Go to <https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions/billing_info/onecall_30/base?key=base&service=onecall_30>
- Follow the instructions to complete the subscription.
- Go to <https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions> and set the "Calls per day (no more than)" to 1,000. This ensures you will never overrun the free calls.

## Error Messages and Troubleshooting

### Low Battery

<img src="showcase/demo-error-low-battery.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears once the battery voltage has fallen below LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.20v). The display will not refresh again until it detects battery voltage above LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE. When battery voltage is between LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE and VERY_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.10v) the esp32 will deep-sleep for periods of LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL (default = 30min) before checking battery voltage again. If the battery voltage falls between LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL and CRIT_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.00v), then the display will deep-sleep for periods VERY_LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL (default = 120min). If battery voltage falls below CRIT_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE, then the esp32 will enter hibernate mode and will require a manual push of the reset (RST) button to begin updating again.

<br clear="left"/>

### WiFi Connection

<img src="showcase/demo-error-wifi.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears when the ESP32 fails to connect to WiFi. If the message reads "WiFi Connection Failed" this might indicate an incorrect password. If the message reads "SSID Not Available" this might indicate that you mistyped the SSID or that the esp32 is out of the range of the access point. The esp32 will retry once every SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min).

<br clear="left"/>

### API Error

<img src="showcase/demo-error-api.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears if an error (client or server) occurs when making an API request to OpenWeatherMap. The second line will give the error code followed by a descriptor phrase. Positive error codes correspond to HTTP response status codes, while error codes <= 0 indicate a client(esp32) error. The esp32 will retry once every SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min).
<br/><br/>
In the example shown to the left, "401: Unauthorized" may be the result of an incorrect API key or that you are attempting to use the One Call v3 API without the proper account setup.

<br clear="left"/>

### Time Server Error

<img src="showcase/demo-error-time.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears when the esp32 fails to fetch the time from NTP_SERVER_1/NTP_SERVER_2. This error sometimes occurs immediately after uploading to the esp32; in this case, just hit the reset button or wait for SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min) and the esp32 to automatically retry. If the error persists, try selecting closer/lower latency time servers or increasing NTP_TIMEOUT.
