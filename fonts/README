Instructions for running ttf_to_adafruit_gfx.sh:

Dependencies:
  fonttools
    fonttools must be installed
    pyftsubset is part of fonttools, a python based command line tool for
    manipulating fonts. pyftsubset will be used to generate 2 subsets of the
    desired font.
  Adafruit fontconvert
    Adafruit provides a tool as part of their Adafruit GFX Library that converts
    font files to c-style arrays that can be used by the before-mentioned
    library. The necessary components have been included as part of this
    repository AND REMAIN LICENSED UNDER ITS ORIGINAL LICENSE AGREEMENT. A COPY
    OF THIS LICENSE IS PROVIDED ALONGSIDE THE SOURCE IN THE 'fontconvert'
    SUB-DIRECTORY OF THIS FOLDER.

How do I generate different sizes of fonts?
  In ttf_to_adafruit_gfx.sh there is an array called SIZES which specifies what
  size fonts should be generated.

How do I generate and add files for a new font?
  Add the .ttf or .otf file to the ./ttf directory then run the script.
  The script will generate a new subdirectory, ./fonts.
  Manually move the newly generated font fonts folder to
  platformio/lib/esp32-weather-epd-assets/fonts.

To run this script execute the following command:
  bash ttf_to_adafruit_gfx.sh

What does this script do?
  This script converts ttf or otf (font) files to c-style arrays to be used by
  the Adafruit GFX Library.

  2 font subsets will be generated:
    1. Extended ASCII (ISO-8859-1)
    2. Numbers (0-9), decimal point (.), dash (-), and the degree symbol (°)

  This is done to conserve EEPROM space.
  (only need 0..9/./-/° for the large primary temperature display)

The fonts used for this project could be swapped out relatively easily if
desired.
